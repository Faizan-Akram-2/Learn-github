git status

git branch (determine branch name)

To push and pull branches to and from remote repositories on GitHub, you'll typically follow these steps:

    Push Branch to Remote Repository:
    To push a branch to a remote repository on GitHub, you can use the following command:
    text

git push origin <branch_name>

This command will push the specified branch to the remote repository (origin) on GitHub.

Pull Branch from Remote Repository:
To pull changes from a remote branch on GitHub to your local repository, you can use the following command:
text

git pull origin <branch_name>

This command will fetch the changes from the remote repository (origin) and merge them into your current branch.

Tracking Remote Branches:
If you want to track a remote branch so that you can push and pull changes more easily, you can set up tracking by using:
text

    git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/<branch_name> <local_branch_name>

    This way, you can simply use git pull and git push without specifying the remote branch each time.

Remember to replace <branch_name> with the actual name of the branch you want to push or pull. Also, make sure you have the necessary permissions to push to the remote repository on GitHub.
